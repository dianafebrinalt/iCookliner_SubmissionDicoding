    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "bread")!, nameCake: "Bread With Walnuts", ingredientCake: " *) 2 ⅓  cups/225 grams chopped walnuts \n *) 2  teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet) \n *) 1  tablespoon/15 grams sea salt \n *) 3  tablespoons/45 milliliters maple syrup \n *) 4  tablespoons/60 milliliters walnut oil \n *) 2  cups/250 grams whole-wheat flour \n *) 3  cups/375 grams bread flour \n *) Coarse cornmeal, for dusting baking sheet", instructionCake: " 1. Toast walnuts in an oven or under the broiler. Set aside to cool. \n 2. Place yeast in a large mixing bowl. Mix salt into 2 cups (473 milliliters) lukewarm water. Stir into yeast. Stir in maple syrup and 2 tablespoons oil. \n 3. Measure 1 cup of the toasted walnuts, place in a food processor with 2 tablespoons of the whole-wheat flour and process until finely ground. Add to bowl along with remaining whole-wheat flour. Stir with a wooden spoon. \n 4. Add bread flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough forms and leaves the sides of the bowl. (At this point you’re better off mixing with your hands.) Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Continue adding bread flour, kneading as you go, until you have a dough that’s a bit on the soft side, only slightly sticky and easy to handle. \n 5. Clean out your bowl, coat it with 1 tablespoon oil, and place dough back into the bowl, turning it so it’s oiled all over. Cover with a cloth and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. \n 6. Punch the dough down, add remaining toasted walnuts and lightly knead them into the dough. Dust a spacious baking sheet with cornmeal. Divide the dough in half, shape into 2 balls and place on the baking sheet. Cover loosely and let rise for an hour. \n 7. Place the oven rack in the lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Slash the tops of the breads with a razor or a lame (a baker’s blade). Do not be tentative about this step; your slashes should be a good half-inch deep, done with a firm, even hand. \n 8. Place the baking sheet in the oven. Throw a handful of ice cubes on the floor of the oven to create steam. Bake 20 minutes. By this time the breads should be a nice honey-brown. Brush them with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, reduce heat to 350 degrees, add more ice cubes and bake about 25 minutes longer, until the breads are well browned and sound hollow when tapped. Allow to cool at least 1 hour before cutting. ", sumber: " Sumber : https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016273-walnut-bread "),
    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "cookies")!, nameCake: "Peanut Butter Cookies", ingredientCake: " *) 1/2 cup granulated sugar \n *) 1/2 cup brown sugar \n *) 1 cup creamy full-fat peanut butter (*see note) \n *) 1 large egg \n *) 1 teaspoon vanilla", instructionCake: " 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. \n 2. With an electric mixer, blend together all the ingredients until combined, smooth, and thick, 2-3 minutes. \n 3. Using a heaping tablespoon cookie scoop, form dough into 1 1/4-inch balls with the palms of your hands. \n 4. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet 2 inches apart. \n 5. Press down with the back of a fork and then press again from the opposite direction, to form a criss-cross pattern on top. \n 6. Bake for about 10 minutes or until the tops are lightly brown and they are about 3 inches wide (all ovens run differently.) They will still be slightly soft if you press on them hot from the oven. \n 7. Remove from oven and let cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely and firm up. \n 8. Enjoy with a tall glass of cold milk!", sumber: " Sumber : https://tasty.co/recipe/3-ingredient-peanut-butter-cookies "),
    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "cupcake")!, nameCake: "Cupcake Strawberry Frosting", ingredientCake: " *) 1 cup freeze-dried strawberries OR 1 1/2 cups (200g) chopped fresh strawberries \n *) 1 cup (224g) unsalted butter, room temperature \n *) 4 cups (460g) powdered sugar \n *) 3–4 tbsp (45-60ml) water or cream, if needed \n *) 1/2 tsp vanilla extract \n *) Pinch or two of salt", instructionCake: " 1. If using fresh strawberries, add the strawberries to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. You should have about 3/4 cups of puree. \n 2. Add the puree to a small sized saucepan and cook over medium heat. Allow the mixture to come to a slow boil, stirring consistently to keep it from burning, until it has thickened and reduced to about 6 tbsp, about 10-15 minutes. To measure, pour the puree into a measuring cup. If it’s more than 6 tbsp (between 1/4 and 1/2 cup), add it back to the pan and continue cooking. \n 3. When the puree has thickened and reduced, pour into a large measuring cup and allow to cool to at least room temperature. This strawberry mixture can be made ahead, if you like, and stored in the fridge. \n 4. If using freeze dried strawberries, add them to a food processor and grind into a fine powder. Set aside. \n 5. Regardless of which version you’re making, add the butter (and shortening, if using) to a large mixer bowl and beat until smooth. \n 6. Add about half of the powdered sugar and beat until well combined and smooth. \n 7. If using the strawberry reduction, add about 3 tablespoons of the reduction and beat until well combined and smooth. If using the freeze dried strawberries, add the powder and about 3 tablespoons of water or cream and beat until well combined and smooth. \n 8. Add the vanilla extract and slowly add the remaining powdered sugar and beat until well combined and smooth. \n 9. Add additional strawberry reduction/milk or cream until your frosting is the right consistency. Use your frosting on cakes, cupcakes, etc. Frosting can be left at room temperature for 1-2 days, but if you aren’t using it right away, I recommend refrigerating it for up to a week or freezing it for about a month.", sumber: " Sumber : https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/homemade-strawberry-frosting-two-ways/"),
    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "donat")!, nameCake: "Dougnuts", ingredientCake: " *) Milk: Liquid activates the yeast. Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough– or you can try buttermilk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren’t as flavorful or rich. \n *) Yeast: You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast. If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter. \n *) Sugar: Sugar sweetens the doughnuts, but it also feeds the yeast, increases its activity, and tenderizes the dough. \n *) Eggs: Eggs provide structure and flavor. \n *) Butter: Melted butter promises enhanced flavor. \n *) Salt & Vanilla Extract: Both add flavor. Try using homemade vanilla extract. \n *) Nutmeg: A little nutmeg is the secret ingredient to that cozy, comforting bakery taste. If you’ve ever made my chocolate chip muffins, you know it adds a delicious pop of flavor! \n *) Flour: All-purpose flour is the dough’s structure. You’ll be tempted to add more and more flour as you mix the dough, but don’t. You want a very soft, pillowy dough for soft, pillowy doughnuts. The dough can still be slightly sticky. When kneading, use extra flour on your hands and work surface.", instructionCake: " 1. Prepare the dough. The dough comes together with a mixer. You can also make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm muscle. After the dough comes together in the mixing bowl, knead it for 2 minutes. \n 2. Let the dough rise. In a relatively warm environment, the dough rises in about 90 minutes. \n 3. Punch down the dough to release the air. \n 4. Roll & cut into doughnuts. Roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the doughnuts using a 3-3.5 inch doughnut cutter. Line 1-2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place doughnuts (and doughnut holes!) onto the lined baking sheet, then lightly cover and allow to rest as you prepare the oil. \n 5. Prepare the oil. Using a heavy-duty pot and an oil thermometer, heat the oil to 375°F (191°C). Place a cooling rack over another baking sheet. \n 6. Fry the doughnuts. Working with 2-3 doughnuts at a time, cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove from the oil and place onto prepared rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. \n 7. Make the glaze. Dip each warm doughnut into the glaze and coat both sides. After about 20 minutes, the glaze will set.", sumber: " Sumber : https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-homemade-glazed-doughnuts/ "),
    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "ispahan")!, nameCake: "Ispahan Macaron", ingredientCake: " FOR THE RASPBERRY JELLY \n *) 200 g Raspberries \n *) 17 g Granulated Sugar \n *) 2 g Gelatine Leaves \n\n FOR THE MACARON SHELLS \n *) 150 g Ground Almonds \n *) 150 g Icing Sugar \n *) 55 g Egg Whites \n *) 2 g Red Food Colouring \n *) 150 g Granulated Sugar \n *) 40 g Water \n *) 55 g Egg Whites \n\n FOR THE LYCHEE AND ROSE GANACHE \n *) 300 g White Chocolate \n *) 1 Can of Lychees preserved in syrup \n *) 30 g Whipping Cream \n\n TO FINISH \n *) 25 g Granulated Sugar \n *) Red Food Colouring", instructionCake: " TO PREPARE THE RASPBERRY JELLY: \n 1. Soak the gelatine leaves for 15 minutes in cold water to soften. \n 2. Using a hand blender, blend the raspberries and sugar to a purée. Strain the purée to remove the pips. Heat a quarter of the purée to 45ºC. Drain and dry the gelatine and add to the hot purée. Stir and add the rest of the raspberry purée. \n 3. Pour it into a gratin dish lined with cling film to a depth of 4mm. Allow to cool for 1 hour at room temperature then put the dish in the freezer for 2 hours. Turn out the jelly and cut it into 1.5cm squares. Return the jelly squares to the freezer. \n\n FOR THE COLOURED SUGAR: \n Preheat the oven to 60 ºC. Mix the sugar with a few drops of food colouring and stir it with a spoon. Spread out the coloured sugar on a baking tray. Put the tray in the oven and dry the sugar for 30 minutes. Alternatively if you use powdered food colouring you don't need to dry the sugar out in the oven. \n\n FOR THE SHELLS: \n 1. Grind the icing sugar and ground almonds in a food processor and sift together the icing sugar and ground almonds into a large bowl. Stir the food colouring into the first portion of egg whites and pour them over the mixture of icing sugar and ground almonds, but do not stir. \n 2. Bring the water and sugar to boil at 118 ºC. Start whisking the second portion of egg whites to soft peaks. When the sugar reaches 118ºC, pour it over the egg whites. Whisk and allow the meringue to cool down to 50 ºC, then fold it into the almond-icing sugar mixture. Spoon the batter into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. \n 3. Pipe rounds of batter about 3.5 cm in diameter, spacing them 2 cm apart on baking trays lined with baking parchment. Rap the baking trays on the work surface covered with a kitchen cloth. Sprinkle every other row with pinches of coloured sugar or ruby glitter. Leave the shells to stand for at least 30 minutes until they form a skin. \n 4. Preheat the fan oven to 180 ºC then put the trays in the oven. Bake for 12 minutes, leave to cool completely before removing the macarons from the paper. \n\n FOR THE LYCHEE AND ROSE GANACHE: \n 1. Drain the lychees. Blend then strain them to obtain a fine purée. You will need 100g purée. \n 2. Bring the cream and lychee purée to the boil. Pour it over the chocolate a little at a time until you get the desired consistency (quite thick), not all of the puree may be needed. Add the rose essence and stir. \n 3. Pour the ganache into a gratin dish and press cling film over the surface of the ganache. Set aside in the fridge for the ganache to thicken. \n\n TO ASSEMBLE: 1. Spoon the ganache into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. Pipe a mound of ganache on to half the shells. Lightly press a square of frozen jelly into the centre and finish with a dot of ganache. Top with the remaining shells. 2. Store the macarons for 24 hours in the fridge and bring back out at the point of serving.", sumber: " Sumber : https://www.patisseriemakesperfect.co.uk/ispahan-macarons/ "),
    Cake(imageCake: UIImage(named: "macaron")!, nameCake: "Macaron Multitude", ingredientCake: " *) 7 ounces confectioners' sugar \n *) 4 ounces almond flour, or almond meal \n *) 4 ounces room temperature egg whites \n *) 3 1/2 ounces granulated sugar \n *) 1 pinch cream of tartar \n *) 1/4 teaspoon gel food coloring", instructionCake: " 1. Gather the ingredients. \n 2. Preheat oven to 325 F. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. \n 3. Add confectioner's sugar and almond meal to a food processor fixed with a metal blade. Run until a fine powder forms. Sift four times, discarding any tiny lumps or almond meal “pebbles” between sifting. Set aside. \n 4. Whip room temperature egg whites using a stand mixer fixed with whisk attachment, on medium speed until foamy. \n 5. Add granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Once mixture thickens and all of the sugar is added, stop mixer. \n 6. Add cream of tartar, scrape down sides of bowl, then turn mixer back on, increasing speed to high. \n 7. Whip mixture for about 5 to 6 minutes or until a peak at the end of the whisk attachment holds its form. (Test this by turning off mixer and checking to see if mixture at the tip of the whisk attachment doesn’t drip). \n 8. Remove bowl from stand mixer and set it on a counter or table. Add a third of the almond meal-confectioner's sugar mixture and fold gently to combine. Add another third of the almond meal-confectioner's sugar mixture, then fold again. \n 9. Add final third once mixture is incorporated, as well as gel food coloring. Fold one final time. The batter that forms after three rounds of folding should be firm with a glossy shine. Test batter by lifting the spatula; if batter drips very slowly from spatula like lava, it’s ready. If not, continue to fold batter for another 30 seconds. Be careful not to overmix.  \n 10. Affix a pastry bag with a #12 plain round tip. Fill bag 3/4-full with batter. Pipe into 1.5-inch rounds on lined baking sheets at least an inch apart. Take care to pipe so that the bag is perpendicular to baking sheet, not at an angle. After piping a circle of batter, flick wrist quickly to the side so that a point doesn’t form at the top of the macaron. (If a tip does form, no worries, smooth it out with a small spatula later). \n 11. Firmly tap baking sheet on work surface to get rid of any air bubbles potentially stuck in batter. Let prepared baking sheets sit at room temperature until a dry shell forms on the macarons. Test by touching batter with fingertip. If fingertip doesn’t stick to batter, macarons are ready for the oven. The “resting” phase can take 20 minutes to 40 minutes, depending on the humidity in the room. \n 12. Bake macarons, one baking sheet at a time, in lower third of oven for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through. When done, the tops will be firm to the touch and the center won't jiggle like jelly.  \n 13. Remove macarons from oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes. Gently peel macarons off parchment paper and transfer to a wire rack. (Do not do this while macarons are still hot, they'll come apart). Repeat with remaining macarons and allow them to cool completely before filling. \n 14.Arrange macarons by twos, top side down, making sure to match sizes best you can. Depending on the size of the macaron, squeeze a nickel to quarter size amount of filling onto the bottom of the macaron. Lay second macaron on top, and very gently press together so that filling expands but doesn’t come out the sides.", sumber: " Sumber : https://www.thespruceeats.com/go-to-gluten-free-macaron-recipe-4019326 "),
